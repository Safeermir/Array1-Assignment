Predict the output.
int main()
{
int sub[50], i ;
for ( i = 0 ; i <= 48 ; i++ ) ;   Here we can see( semicolon )so for loop run for 0-48 
and the value of i becomes 49 becaus during last iteration i is 48 then by i++ it becoes 49

{
sub[i] = i ;   as i becomes 49 therefore sub[i] becomes49 
cout<<sub[i]<<endl ; 49 will print 
}
return 0;
}


output will be 49
